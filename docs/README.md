# Trigger , emulation and analysis tools

The `trgtools` repository contains a collection of tools and scripts to emulate, test and analyze the performance of trigger and trigger algorithms.

- `process_tpstream`: Exaple of a simple pipeline to process TPStream files (slice by slide) and apply a trigger activity algorithm
- `tp_dump.py`:  Script that loads TPStream files containing trigger primitives and plots various diagnostic information. [Documentation](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/trgtools/blob/develop/docs/tp-dump.md).
