# Trigger Emulation & Analysis Tools

The `trgtools` repository contains a collection of tools and scripts to emulate, test and analyze the performance of trigger and trigger algorithms.

- `process_tpstream`: Example of a simple pipeline to process TPStream files (slice by slice) and apply a trigger activity algorithm.
- `ta_dump.py`: Script that loads TPStream files containing trigger activities and plots various diagnostic information. [Documentation](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/trgtools/blob/develop/docs/ta-dump.md).
