# Trigger Emulation & Analysis Tools

The `trgtools` repository contains a collection of tools and scripts to emulate, test and analyze the performance of trigger and trigger algorithms.

- `process_tpstream`: Example of a simple pipeline to process TPStream files (slice by slice) and apply a trigger activity algorithm.
- `ta_dump.py`: Script that loads HDF5 files containing trigger activities and plots various diagnostic information. [Documentation](ta-dump.md).
- `tc_dump.py`: Script that loads HDF5 files containing trigger primitives and plots various diagnostic information. [Documentation](tc-dump.md).
- `tp_dump.py`: Script that loads HDF5 files containing trigger primitives and plots various diagnostic information. [Documentation](tp-dump.md).
